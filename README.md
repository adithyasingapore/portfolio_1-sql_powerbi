# Portfolio Project 1 - SQL and PowerBI - AdventureWorks

Welcome to my first portfolio project. In this data analysis project, I clean the AdventureWorks dataset with SQL, then visualise it as an interactive dashboard with PowerBI and also export a static version of the dashboard as a PDF.

Project Files:
There are 3 project files (1 SQL, 1 PowerBI and 1 PDF) and 5 data table files (4 CSVs and 1 Excel Worksheet) in this repository. The data tables are the output of the SQL queries, where I clean the tables by sorting and exporting only those columns which are needed for visualisation in PowerBI.
