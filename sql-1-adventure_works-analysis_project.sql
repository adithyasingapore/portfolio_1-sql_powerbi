The 'Status' column lists those products which are 'Current'. Those which are not are NULLs.
So, I have added ISNULL to tell SQL to display NULLs in that column as 'Outdated', i.e. they are not current.

The OrderDateKey column's first 4 digits are the year.

Our project requires data of the prior 2 years, so we add '-2'.
Using the above function will allow us to only filter the data for the last 2 years.
